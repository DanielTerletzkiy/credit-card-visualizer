# Features (WIP)
- This will include a visualization for a credit card with gradients for each card company (MasterCard, Visa, etc).
- Front and back of card with animations
- Hover the Card to show the back, or flip automatically when editing the CVC field
- Plain CSS + HTML Inputfields to enter Details

# TODO
- ~~Add export to parent Components~~
- Add more ui elements to back plate
- ~~Input to be optional~~
- Change gradients with props
